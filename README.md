# Notifications App

This is a Django app for managing user notifications with a simple REST API.

---

## Features

- **List notifications** for the authenticated user.
- **Mark notifications as read**.
- **Delete notifications** (only your own).
- All endpoints require authentication.
- Each user can only access and manage their own notifications.

## API Endpoints

Base URL: `/api/notifications/`

| Method | Endpoint                        | Description                       | Request Body / Params |
|--------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| GET    | `/api/notifications/`           | List all your notifications       | ‚Äî                    |
| PATCH  | `/api/notifications/<pk>/read/` | Mark a notification as read       | ‚Äî                    |
| DELETE | `/api/notifications/<pk>/delete/`| Delete a notification             | ‚Äî                    |

## Setup

1. **Add the app to `INSTALLED_APPS`** in your Django settings.

2. **Include the URLs** in your project's `urls.py`:
   ```python
   path('api/notifications/', include('notifications.urls')),
   ```

3. **Run migrations** (if you have a `Notification` model):
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations notifications
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

---

## Permissions

- All endpoints require authentication.
- Users can only access and manage their own notifications.

# Currency Rate Alert (Set Alert) API ‚Äî Documentation

This document explains how to use the "Set Alert" (Currency Rate Alert) feature in your Django backend, including all key modifications, API endpoint details, and expected request/response formats.

---

## üî• What is ‚ÄúSet Alert‚Äù?

The **Currency Rate Alert** feature allows users to set up alerts for currency exchange rates.  
When a rate falls within a user-defined range, the backend will create an in-app notification for the user.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Modifications

### 1. **Model**
- You already have `CurrencyAlert` in `Transaction/models.py`.
- Fields include:
  - `user`, `base_currency`, `target_currency`, `min_rate`, `max_rate`, `target_rate`, `is_active`, `notify_interval`, `created_at`, etc.

### 2. **Serializer**
- Enhanced to accept either:
  - A single `target_rate` (auto-calculates a min/max range), **or**
  - Both `min_rate` and `max_rate` explicitly.
- Ensures `user` and `created_at` are always read-only (set in views, not by user input).
- Validation ensures `min_rate < max_rate`.

### 3. **Views**
- Added `CreateCurrencyAlertView`, `UpdateCurrencyAlertView`, and `DeleteCurrencyAlertView`.
- Each requires authentication.
- The create view sets the alert for the logged-in user.
- Update and delete views ensure only the owner can modify/delete.

### 4. **Celery Task**
- The periodic task (`check_currency_alerts`) checks all active alerts.
- If the live rate is within a user‚Äôs defined range _and_ the notification interval has passed, it creates a Notification for the user.
- The frontend can fetch notifications using your existing notifications API.

### 5. **URLs**
- Endpoints are registered in `Transaction/urls.py`:
  - `POST   /transaction/currency-alerts/` ‚Äî Create alert
  - `PATCH  /transaction/currency-alerts/<id>/` ‚Äî Update alert
  - `DELETE /transaction/currency-alerts/<id>/delete/` ‚Äî Delete alert

---

## üö¶ API Usage

### 1. **Create a Rate Alert**

**Endpoint:**  
`POST /transaction/currency-alerts/`

**Request Body:**  
- Option 1: With `target_rate` (auto-range, ~¬±1%)
```json
{
  "base_currency": "USD",
  "target_currency": "ETB",
  "target_rate": 55.50,
  "is_active": true,
  "notify_interval": "01:00:00"
}
```
- Option 2: With explicit range
```json
{
  "base_currency": "USD",
  "target_currency": "ETB",
  "min_rate": 55.0,
  "max_rate": 56.0,
  "is_active": true,
  "notify_interval": "01:00:00"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Alert created successfully."
}
```
*Validation errors will be returned if fields are missing or inconsistent.*

---

### 2. **Update an Alert**

**Endpoint:**  
`PATCH /transaction/currency-alerts/<id>/`

**Request Body:** (Any updatable field, e.g. set is_active to false)
```json
{
  "is_active": false
}
```
**Response:**  
```json
{
  "message": "Alert updated.",
  "data": {
    ... // updated alert fields
  }
}
```

---

### 3. **Delete an Alert**

**Endpoint:**  
`DELETE /transaction/currency-alerts/<id>/delete/`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Alert deleted."
}
```

---

### 4. **How Notification Works**

- The backend periodically checks all active alerts.
- If the current rate is within the user‚Äôs set range and enough time has passed since the last notification (`notify_interval`), a new Notification object is created for the user.
- Users can fetch their notifications via your existing `/notifications/` API endpoint.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example Frontend Usage

1. **Set an alert:**  
   Make a POST request as shown above.
2. **Wait for the rate to match.**
3. **Your frontend polls `/notifications/` to show the user when an alert is triggered.**

---

## üìù Example cURL

**Create:**
```sh
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/transaction/currency-alerts/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token <user_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"base_currency": "USD", "target_currency": "ETB", "target_rate": 55.5, "is_active": true, "notify_interval": "01:00:00"}'
```

**Update:**
```sh
curl -X PATCH https://yourdomain.com/transaction/currency-alerts/4/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token <user_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"is_active": false}'
```

**Delete:**
```sh
curl -X DELETE https://yourdomain.com/transaction/currency-alerts/4/delete/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token <user_token>"
```

## üü¢ Summary of Key Backend Files

- `models.py` ‚Äî defines `CurrencyAlert`
- `serializers.py` ‚Äî defines validation and field handling for alerts
- `views.py` ‚Äî implements create, update, delete for alerts
- `tasks.py` ‚Äî implements alert-checking Celery task
- `urls.py` ‚Äî registers endpoints

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- The `user` field is never set by the client; it‚Äôs always assigned from the authenticated user in the view.
- `notify_interval` uses Django‚Äôs duration string format, e.g. `"01:00:00"` for one hour.
- "target_rate" is optional but, if provided, both min/max are automatically derived using ¬±1% of target.
- Client can also provide both min/max directly.

---

## üß© Integration Checklist

- [x] POST/PATCH/DELETE endpoints for alerts are in place.
- [x] Celery task notifies in-app via Notification model.
- [x] Frontend can set, update, delete alerts, and poll notifications.
